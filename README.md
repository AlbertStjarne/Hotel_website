# Website for Hotel BT

A website for the imaginary Hotel BT with Home, Contact and About pages. It was built non-responsive at first with eg floats and then made responsive afterwards in a mobile stylesheet.

Icons are from Fontawsome via CDN.

The contact form is not being submitted.

Responsiveness is tested on iPhone 6/7/8, iPhone X and Galaxy S5 in the Chrome browser.
